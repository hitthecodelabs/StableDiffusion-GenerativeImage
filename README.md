# StableDiffusion-GenerativeImage

A simple Python application to generate images using the Stable Diffusion model.

## Description

This repository contains a script for generating images from text prompts using the open version of the Stable Diffusion model, powered by the Hugging Face's `diffusers` library. The script is designed to be easy to use and customizable for different prompts.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch (with GPU support for better performance)
- `diffusers` library
- `transformers` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository folder in your terminal.
3. Run the script using Python.
Example:
```bash
python generate_image.py
```

## Usage
To use the script, simply replace the prompt in the generate_image function call with your desired text. The script will generate an image based on this prompt and save it to your local directory.

```bash
generate_image("Your text prompt here")
```
